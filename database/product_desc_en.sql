(169,	'<p>f you&#39;ve ever played a video game with giant robots in it that&nbsp;<em>wasn&#39;t</em>&nbsp;based on an anime, you&#39;ve probably felt the influence of BattleTech. The intricate war game originated the MechWarrior series of first-person combat games and inspired many others, but BattleTech&#39;s own hard-hitting turn-based tactics have never seen a proper video-successor of their own. That&#39;s finally changed with Harebrained Scheme&#39;s BattleTech, the long-awaited result of a 2015 crowdfunding campaign.</p><p>How does this video game adaptation of such venerable source material hold up in a world of XCOMs and Into the Breaches? I collated some particularly illuminating snippets from across the Inner Sphere of games criticism so you can get a feel for how reviewers are finding various key parts of the game.&nbsp;</p><p>The UI has so much information to impart that it can initially seem a little overwhelming, but with time and greater fluency I came to appreciate how much it manages to express with relatively few elements. BattleTech has no undo function for a turn gone awry, so it&#39;s vital to know exactly where your mechs will end up after a move, what they&#39;ll be able to see, and who can see them - the UI achieves this. There&#39;s plenty of detail to dig into, too - while initially you might see a red signature on the long-range scanners and not know what to do about it, with more experience you&#39;ll learn to pay attention to the tonnage of the incoming foe, weigh this against your understanding of the various mech types, and plan accordingly.</p><p><strong>A crunchy war game, adapted expertly -&nbsp;Waypoint&nbsp;(Unscored)</strong></p><p>With this new adaptation, Harebrained Schemes have made a game that captures both the lurid imaginary spectacle of mech combat, and its tactical suspense. Crucially, however, they&#39;ve left most - though not all - of the board game&#39;s daunting granularity and detail in the past. BattleTech takes dozens of different mech types and weapons, several different types of movement and attack, plus the crucial role of skilled pilots within those mechs, and puts them all inside a fast-paced tactics game. It feels like the BattleTech board game in all the right ways, but battles unfold in less than an hour, rather than the 3-4 hour sessions the board game demanded. You also don&#39;t need to keep a calculator and notepad next to you to play</p><p><strong>More accessible than you might think -&nbsp;Destructoid&nbsp;(8/10)&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>BattleTech operates on a turn-based combat system where cover matters, as does positioning. You can jump jet down heights to get a better vantage point, seemingly menial environmental factors like water cool down an overheated mech, and sprinting (a standard top-down strategy mechanic) grants evasion charges. Nearly every facet of BattleTech has its own rules, but its secret sauce is that none of those rules are overly complicated. For instance melee has its own parameters (it uses piloting skill, ignores evasion, and removes guarded), which is a specific answer to a specific problem. Hits and range also matter depending on your mech&#39;s loadout (something you&#39;ll know going in at a glance), and stats can go down on a whim. You&#39;ll need to know the kit of each mech to solve any problems that arise, but that comes naturally after just five mission or so.</p><p><strong>RNG can be a huge bummer -&nbsp;IGN&nbsp;(7/10)&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&quot;There&#39;s a lot I love about the strategy behind each fight; positioning, heat management, and targeting all offer interesting decisions to make and different strategies to learn. But it&#39;s hard not to feel that all those best-laid plans can go to hell simply because of a lucky shot or an unlucky miss, and in a way that&#39;s much more frustrating than you see in other percentage-based tactics games like XCOM 2. [...] The difference between dealing 100 damage to single part instead of spreading it out across multiple pieces is night and day, and whether or not you do is largely out of your hands. I&#39;ve had dozens of moments where I only needed a few missiles to land on a specific part to finish it off, doing everything I possibly can to maximize those odds, but they&#39;ll just pepper the enemy&#39;s unscratched armor instead. That stings, and feels downright disgusting when that enemy then turns my way, gets lucky, and lands a full salvo on a nearly full health center torso to instantly destroy one of my more pristine mechs.&quot;</p><p><strong>Giant robots can be awfully slow -&nbsp;Rock, Paper, Shotgun&nbsp;(Unscored)&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The scales are tipped massively, maddeningly in favour of watching rather than acting here. Every animation is too long (even after all the &#39;glamcam&#39; over-the-shoulder action sequence options are turned off), each action is followed by numerous ticker tape-slow stat and status updates, automated camera pans have all the speed and grace of a shopping trolley with four rusted wheels, and the entire game lapses into unexpected motionlessness for a few seconds as frequently as the exhausted pusher of said trolley. My heart sinks when new enemies lurch into view &ndash; not because of the (significant) threat they represent, but because more units means more waiting.</p><p><strong>MINIMUM:</strong><br />OS: 64-bit Windows 7 or Higher<br />Processor: Intel&reg; Core&trade; i3-2105 or AMD&reg; Phenom&trade; II X3 720<br />Memory: 8 GB RAM<br />Graphics: Nvidia&reg; GeForce&trade; GTX 560 Ti or AMD&reg; ATI Radeon&trade; HD 5870 (1 GB VRAM)<br />DirectX: Version 11<br />Storage: 30 GB available space<br />Sound Card: DirectX 9 sound device<br />Additional Notes: Multiplayer is compatible between Windows and Mac versions.<br /><br /><strong>RECOMMENDED:</strong><br />OS: 64-bit Windows 7 or Higher<br />Processor: Intel&reg; Core&trade; i5-4460 or AMD&reg; FX-4300<br />Memory: 16 GB RAM<br />Graphics: Nvidia&reg; GeForce&trade; GTX 670 or AMD&reg; Radeon&trade; R9 285 (2 GB VRAM)<br />DirectX: Version 11<br />Storage: 30 GB available space<br />Sound Card: DirectX 9 sound device<br />Additional Notes: Multiplayer is compatible between Windows and Mac versions.</p>'),

(165,	'<p>Between&nbsp;<em>Bubsy</em>&nbsp;and Big the Cat from the&nbsp;<em>Sonic</em>&nbsp;series, cats haven&#39;t always had the best of times in video games, but that&#39;s certainly not the case with&nbsp;<strong><em>Another Sight</em></strong>. The title, which did a solid job of building real-world names into a story of shifting realities and magic realism, included Hodge, a cat companion who also took the role of one of two playable characters. Now, Hodge is back in the free Steam prequel&nbsp;<em>Another Sight: Hodge&#39;s Journey</em>.</p><p>Hodge clearly made a big impression with the development team over at&nbsp;Lunar Great Wall Studios, because the little guy has been made the key playable character&nbsp;this time around. In&nbsp;<em>Another Sight: Hodge&#39;s Journey</em>, the plot follows the cat, much as the name suggests. This brings with it some key positives, although there are some major drawbacks as well.</p><p>It&#39;s worth noting that many of the best bits of&nbsp;<em>Another Sight</em>&nbsp;revolved around Hodge, so it certainly makes plenty of sense for the cat to have the focus this time around. In the core game, Hodge had a much greater movement speed, and flexibility when it came to overcoming obstacles. While fellow playable character Kit sometimes felt sluggish to control, Hodge was much better.</p><p>For&nbsp;<em>Hodge&#39;s Journey</em>,&nbsp;Lunar Great Wall Studios has rightly put an emphasis on this part of the game. The puzzles here are less cerebral on the whole than those in the main game, instead primarily based around jumping and climbing, with some rodent-herding thrown in for good measure. Although the blend of the two fits&nbsp;<em>Another Sight</em>&nbsp;on the whole, for a short prequel such as this having a more physical element to the gameplay suits it well.</p><p>In a way, this prequel acts as a demo of the key game, showcasing what&nbsp;<em>Another Sight</em>&nbsp;has to offer to those who might want to follow it up with the main event.&nbsp;However, more than the gameplay this is especially true of the game&#39;s art style. Whereas&nbsp;<em>Another Sight</em>&nbsp;slowly dropped players into the more abstract elements of its world,&nbsp;<em>Hodge&#39;s Journey</em>&nbsp;is much more forthright with its design.</p><p>The result is just as impressive as the main game, with the more down-to-earth levels matched well with the gravity-defying, lush colors of the artistic moments. As such,&nbsp;<em>Hodge&#39;s Journey</em>&nbsp;is still a joy to look at, with some stunning moments along the way, reminiscent of a steampunk fairy tale.</p><p>That said, there are a few issues here. Control was a main problem with&nbsp;<em>Another Sight</em>, with awkward character movements a big factor, and&nbsp;<em>Hodge&#39;s Journey</em>&nbsp;still has this issue. Although Hodge has more fluent movement, there are still some awkward animations and delays that may leave players feeling a little aggrieved here and there. Hodge moves like a real cat a lot of the time - albeit with a lot more purpose - yet the pinpoint accuracy for some jumps makes Hodge feel a little too clumsy.</p><p>As well as this, there&#39;s a lack of variety here in comparison to the main title. The dynamic between Hodge and teenager&nbsp;Kit was one of the major parts of what made&nbsp;<em>Another Sight</em>&nbsp;an interesting puzzle game, both due to their characters and what each provided from a gameplay perspective. By just having Hodge&#39;s side of things, it does feel a little less nuanced.</p><p>Nonetheless, for a quick - and free - prequel it&#39;s hard not to enjoy&nbsp;<em>Another Sight: Hodge&#39;s Journey</em>. From its gorgeous visuals and tone through to the character of Hodge himself, there&#39;s plenty to recommend, although the flaws of the core game are still here for all to see. Certainly something to try out.</p>'),

(161,	'<p>I&rsquo;ve often wondered when the world would be getting a golf game where you control gargantuan mechs in a quest for victory on the fairway. I remember watching Bagger Vance back in the day and wondering how much better this film would be if you weren&rsquo;t humans, but giant robots instead. Well, it seems as though No Goblin has found a way to tap into my noggin and read my mind; 100ft Robot Golf is a game where you play a very flamboyant and extravagant game of golf, destroying surroundings, beating up your opponent with your golf club and watching it all unfold in a wonderfully shit 90s-inspired anime.</p><p>In all seriousness though, 100ft Robot Golf is decent; it may be a weird amalgamation of sport and sci-fi, but there&rsquo;s something about it that keeps you going back for more. There has been plenty of sports games in the past that don&rsquo;t really offer much other than playing the sport itself, but they don&rsquo;t need to (Rockstar&rsquo;s Table Tennis comes to mind) because they&rsquo;re fun. It&rsquo;s clunky, messy at times and the way it looks as you destroy the various buildings and bridges looks cheap compared to its peers, but the controls make it easy to pick up and play with a difficulty level far too easy to struggle with and opponent AI that is laughable at times.</p><p>You can control plenty of different robots all assigned a similar mechanic to hit the ball. Manage the power at which you hit the ball, adjust the spin you place on it and then just belt it down the course. Sometimes you&rsquo;ll have gauges where you&rsquo;ll need to stop the dial in the correct place, but generally they all follow a similar pattern. You have the choice of three clubs (driver, wedge, putter) and three ranges of hitting the ball, so getting a bit of extra height when in some lava sand can be vital for getting the ball back onto sturdier ground, or hitting a solid mid-range drive will get you closer to the putting green than maybe a low or high shot would. You can&rsquo;t see the whole course at any given time, but there is a marker for you to see where the ball needs to go, and you can look where your shot will land depending on whether you get the right amount of power and accuracy in the shot.</p><p>In an attempt to win, you can block the shots of your opponents by standing in the way or moving into the ball&rsquo;s path. You can also destroy scenery with your club, rockets, power swords and other weapons and in turn, block your opponent&rsquo;s shot that way. Golf normally consists of making par, but that&rsquo;s not always the case. It&rsquo;s more of a race between you and your foes and reaching first place will guarantee you the win. Sometimes you&rsquo;ll be against one other player or three, and the more you play the trickier it gets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The story is over-the-top and littered with poor acting. The main character&rsquo;s voice is really irritating, and even the supporting character&rsquo;s performances begin to grate on you after a while. The commentary team tries to lighten the mood of the matches and normally succeeds, but even then they begin to repeat themselves, even before the games have finished. Bog standard animation aside, the visuals are pretty weak. It&rsquo;s very blocky and void of proper details, making it feel like a last gen title as opposed to something fresh out of the gate.</p><p>The multiplayer lets you play locally with up to four players as does the online game, and there&rsquo;s a challenge to complete all of the courses in the fastest time, called the Hall of Fame. It doesn&rsquo;t have the widest range of modes or options, even when customising your robot, but the basic gameplay helps to hold your enjoyment, even if the campaign is comprised of some bad visuals and voice acting. Playable in VR, you&rsquo;re probably better off only trying it once, because it&rsquo;s pretty awkward to control from the viewpoint the VR provides.</p><p>Despite everything, after a few rounds 100ft Robot Golf grabs you despite its flaws. It may be rife with idiosyncrasies and some questionable gameplay, but it&rsquo;s by no means dull.</p>'),

(168,	'<p><strong>American Fugitive</strong>&nbsp;is a modern take on classic sandbox action offering a new 3D top-down open-world single-player experience. Welcome to Redrock County, a sleepy&nbsp;<strong>American</strong>&nbsp;town with a booming criminal underbelly. You take the role of Will Riley.</p><p>Will Riley has made some bad choices. Friend to lowlifes of various persuasions and no stranger to the odd legal and moral transgression of his own, he winds up in a tight spot when police find him standing over the body of his recently deceased father. He acts to preserve himself by making yet more bad choices, such as escaping prison and diving right back into a life of crime while on the run.</p><p>Often when we occupy a criminal&rsquo;s shoes in games, film or TV, we&rsquo;re shown a few glimpses of their underlying kindness to endear them to us. This top-down action-game-meets-heist-drama has different ideas. As soon as he busts out of Redrock County jail in this fictionalised 1980s US deep south, Riley goes back to the only way of life he knows. For the player, that means two-bit burglaries, acts of wanton vandalism and appropriately &ndash; given the developer Fallen Tree Games&rsquo; obvious affection for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2013/sep/15/making-grand-theft-auto-video\">old-school Grand Theft Auto</a>&nbsp;&ndash; a serious body count.</p><p>American Fugitive isn&rsquo;t content to milk a wave of nostalgia for tabloid-baiting classic games. It dives deeper into the nitty-gritty of your crimes than video games of the 1990s did. When you break into a home, the bread and butter of Riley&rsquo;s exploits for many missions, you&rsquo;re given a top-down floorplan to hurriedly loot for valuables while a timer ticks away at the top of the screen, counting down until the police arrive. Rummaging around in houses or abandoned vehicles lets you fill your inventory with weapons, food and items that make you think about how you&rsquo;re going to pull off a job. To that end, there&rsquo;s a nefarious thrill to jimmying a window open with a crowbar you found under a burned-out car.</p><p>Otherwise, the action that comprises Riley&rsquo;s career &ndash; throwing drivers out of their cars before careening the wrong way down highways, running and gunning, police shootouts &ndash; is fun, if a little functional. Although the physics effects attempt to sell the drama of every car chase, each encounter with the law feels much the same.</p><p>Less entertaining are the drawn-out exchanges between Riley and his friends (or, more accurately, mission dispensers). From scrapyard owners to femme fatales and fat-necked crime lords, the characters feel as if they&rsquo;ve been picked at random from a stockroom of American stereotypes, and the writing fails to enliven them.

(213,	'<p>If you&#39;ve ever dreamt of being a Japanese school girl, or wanted a modern&nbsp;<em>Sailor Moon</em>&nbsp;role-playing game,&nbsp;<em>Blue Reflection</em>&nbsp;is about as close as you are going to get. You play first-year Hinako Shirai as she attends Hoshinomiya High School. Student by day, sword-wielding magical hero also by day.&nbsp;</p><p>After injuring her leg, Hinako&#39;s dream to become an Etoile, French for top ballerina apparently, looks unlikely. She meets friends new and old and suddenly is transported into a another world. She later meets Yuzuki and Lime Shijou who introduce her to her magical abilities which include allowing her to use her leg once more. Of course they have the most<em>&nbsp;Sailor Moon</em>-esque transformations into their cute and frilly fighting outfits.</p><p>There is an overarching threat that looms, but the story is focused on the day to day high school like of Hinako as she makes friends and develops relationships with them. Whereas in&nbsp;<em>Persona 4</em>&nbsp;the daily interactions mostly contribute to the overall plot, most of your interactions, both critical path and side missions, are episodic slice-of-life moments. &quot;School girl simulator&quot; is the first term that comes to mind.&nbsp;</p><p>Hinako and her friends learn how to use social media, go shopping, do their makeup, talk about boys, and have some contests against each other. It&#39;s quite a feminine experience that would make the&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Gears of War</em>&nbsp;tough guy audiences run away.&nbsp;<em>Blue Reflection</em>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<em>almost</em>&nbsp;a game made for girls, but the aforementioned activities aren&#39;t played and there&#39;s just enough softcore fan service that let&#39;s on who this is intended for.</p><p>Makeup, shopping, and so on are performed in cutscenes without the player performing any input or choices. You can select outfits for each of the characters in the real world, but it appears most of those will be DLC as I only had the swimsuits available after the default uniform.</p><p>There is an option to switch to a wet version of each costume though, which makes transparent white shirts even more transparent. Like I said, almost a girls game, but not quite. If doing make-up and dressing up is the experience you are looking for, this game doesn&#39;t quite have it. You&#39;d want to play something like&nbsp;<em>Style Savvy</em>.</p><p>While not entirely a game for girls, it&#39;s not entirely a softcore porn game either. Yes, there are scenes with the girls in one-piece swimsuits, a few in their underwear, and Hinako can take a bath at night, but it never crosses into&nbsp;<em>Gal Gun</em>&nbsp;territory. The camera is quite restricted, so you can&#39;t exact have a&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts II</em>&nbsp;Kairi experience either.</p><p>The translation seems to have been done in-house. It&#39;s correct for the most part, although there are some typos and weird things. &quot;Enter the bath&quot; is a bit of a literal translation, but it wouldn&#39;t confuse anyone that it means &quot;take a bath.&quot; The one thing that threw me off slightly early on was half the time Lime is called Lime, and other times it is written as &quot;Raimu.&quot; It&#39;s the same name, same character, but they apparently didn&#39;t choose one. Still, I will take some unnatural lines here and there over memes and localization teams who are instructed to inject personality and humor where it doesn&#39;t exist any day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Regarding the aforementioned activities (shopping, going to a restaurant, visiting an amusement park, doing makeup, etc), some are main missions or side missions, and others are social link-style dates where you improve your relationship with side characters. The cast is all female and while there are some &quot;more-than-friends&quot; moments, no romantic relationships develop in the games. Raising your affinity with side characters affects their performance as support characters in battle.</p><p>The playable party consists of only Hinako, Suzuki, and Lime, but you can assign one of the many support characters to the main cast. When you perform an attack, you can press a button to activate a support characters move. The tennis girl will spike a tennis ball into the enemy for damage, while a girl who likes makeup will sprinkle makeup onto the party to heal them.</p><p>Hinako&#39;s stats can be raised by choosing certain activities at home such as stretching, studying, or taking a bath. However the main way to strengthen the party is through fighting in the Common, where enemies linger about along with obtainable items. Enemies are easily outrun if you don&#39;t want to fight, but while the combat is particularly deep or difficult you&#39;ll want to take the time to level up through out the game.&nbsp;</p><p>Leveling up allows you points to put into four basic stats: attack, defense, support, and speed. Obviously they&#39;re all important but I found a focus on attack and speed made the game go smoothly since the turn-based combat is based on cool-down time between attacks. Having all HP and MP restored after each battle, regardless of difficulty level, helps as well. There&#39;s no equipment like armor or weapons to acquire, so the fighting portion of the game is as simple as the main plot.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The appeal of&nbsp;<em>Blue Reflection</em>&nbsp;is similar to the appeal of idol groups. The music isn&#39;t very good, but a lot of people just like to oogle at the girls because they&#39;re extremely cute, and sometimes that pours over a little into semi-softcore fan service. Gameplay and story aren&#39;t the reasons anyone will play&nbsp;<em>Blue Reflection</em>, rather it&#39;s those who are enthralled by the cuteness of young Japanese girls and the day-to-day slice-of-life experience.</p><p>Even that though isn&#39;t the most in-depth, as there&#39;s not a ton of interaction or options to enjoy the daily life of a teenage girl. Perhaps if there were fewer characters they or the life simulation gameplay could be fleshed out a bit more. There is no schoolwork to be done, despite a study option, no dialogue options, no city to explore, and not many hangout activities. The school is decently sized, but small considered it&#39;s the only location in the real world, and the only thing to do in is talk to girls for the next mission so you might as well transport to the room to skip Hinako&#39;s slow run.&nbsp;</p><p>Obviously the shooter or sports crowd won&#39;t play this; it&#39;s aimed for a certain niche. For those people, no aspect of&nbsp;<em>Blue Reflection</em>&nbsp;is at all bad, but I just get the feeling that rather than focus on fleshing out a few things, they tried to incorporate too many that all ended up quite shallow. Nothing here will anger or upset you, but nothing will amaze or move you either. It&#39;s a steady, repetitive line to the end without any sort of escalation, but not everything need to be full of crazy turns and ups and downs.</p>'),

(192,	'<p>&nbsp;tend to avoid direct comparisons when analyzing a video game, but the fact that&nbsp;<em>Hover: Revolt&nbsp;of Gamers</em>&nbsp;proudly exclaims its relationship with&nbsp;<em>Jet Set Radio</em>, it becomes inevitable. It plays on the nostalgia heartstrings pretty hard, even getting composer Hideki Naganuma to contribute a couple of tracks. &nbsp;</p><p><em>Jet Set Radio</em>&nbsp;is my favorite game of all time, so I jumped headfirst into&nbsp;<em>Hover</em>&nbsp;(I am never using that full title ever again) with a giant grin on my face, excited for what awaited me. After all,&nbsp;<em>JSR</em>&nbsp;is quite old and the controls don&#39;t hold up as well as I&#39;d like, so there&#39;s lots of room for improvement. While the controls are definitely better here, I can&#39;t say the same for everything else.</p><p>The core movement mechanics of&nbsp;<em>Hover</em>&nbsp;feel great. It&rsquo;s exciting to grind and wall-ride around the environment while taking in the visuals and looking for quicker or more exciting routes. When everything clicks, oh boy does it look great. Flipping and grinding all over the place is stylish and exhilarating, as it is often done way above the ground due to the vertical nature of the maps. That being said, it&rsquo;s not all peaches and roses.</p><p>I can&rsquo;t begin to count how many times I&rsquo;ve mashed jump in an attempt to get up to a ledge or over a vertical obstacle. The character will auto-latch to ledges, and occasionally a ledge is just out of jump height range, so the process usually becomes an attempt to jump into the wall, wall-jump, and hope that the physics works out such that the character grabs the ledge. Other times, the geography and geometry of the world just don&#39;t work out well. There have been a few instances of being &ldquo;in the zone,&rdquo; only to jump and trick directly into a random low-hanging wall or bar that kills everything.</p><p>Luckily, a key feature of&nbsp;<em>Hover</em>&nbsp;is its ability to rewind and &ldquo;undo&rdquo; mistakes. This is very handy during races or just standard navigation when a wrong jump or unexpected geometry gets in the way and causes a huge fall down to the bottom of the map. The rewind function allows players to reverse time for up to about eight seconds and course-correct big mistakes. This is a great quality-of-life feature to have, although it forces the player to drop what they&#39;re holding, so it&rsquo;s useless in certain situations and modes.</p><p>The tutorial does a decent job of introducing the movement mechanics but leaves a lot to be desired overall. A handful of mechanics are not even remotely explained in the tutorial, leaving players with a lot of confusion and frustration when missions ask something of the player previously unexplained by the game itself. On top of all this, the player must complete the tutorial every time a new character is created. While I understand this concept canonically (players are freshly created clones), it is an absolutely frustrating practice. There is at least a way to skip most of it, but it&#39;s completely hidden and if they didn&#39;t add an achievement mentioning it, I would have never known.</p><p>It&rsquo;s because of the solid gameplay mechanics that the racing missions are so much of a success. They take the player around to places they may not have been or explored quite yet, and the checkpoints direct the player into specific paths, purposefully showing off one route or another. Eventually, you&rsquo;ll find yourself thinking &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve been here before! I can head this way to get to where I need to go&rdquo; because of a previous race.</p><p>Unfortunately, the other mission types aren&rsquo;t as exciting. The biggest mission type outside of races is Gameball. A ball drops in the center of the arena, and each player must defend their goal while simultaneously trying to score on the opponent&rsquo;s goal. In theory, players are using their movement skills and abilities to outmaneuver their opponent(s) and throw the ball into the goal. In my experience, when playing against AI or other humans, everything just takes way too long and nothing feels particularly strategic. These missions are mandatory to progress, but if the character you play as isn&rsquo;t specialized in throwing or other stats related to the game type, it can become a chore. The developer has commented that the intention is to create a character that&nbsp;does&nbsp;specialize in this area, but doing so begins to feel monotonous.</p><p>Unlocking characters involves completing their string of missions; the missions for a particular character are usually the same type. I get that they have their own specialties, but doing these missions in order starts to feel like a huge drag, especially if the mission type isn&rsquo;t particularly interesting. I prayed to any and all gods that would listen that each Gameball mission would be my last for the character unlock. Some missions have just about&nbsp;no&nbsp;direction and feel aimless and vague, resulting in frustration.</p><p>The game&rsquo;s direction as a whole often feels aimless. There is a core set of missions to follow to advance the plot, but it&rsquo;s easy to get lost and/or distracted by the plethora of other missions available. The plot isn&rsquo;t set up strongly, and it more or less feels as if the player is just dumped into a random world filled with tons of meaningless missions. Again, the strength of the core gameplay and interesting visuals do a lot to alleviate the otherwise poor design, but it&rsquo;s hard not to stare at the proverbial man behind the curtain and feel disappointed. It doesn&#39;t help that bugs have erased and halted my progress more than once.</p><p>Creating characters is an interesting experience. At first, players can only choose a generic hooded person who has no personality at all. As mentioned, it&rsquo;s possible to unlock more by completing a string of missions from the NPC. These characters come with specialties, usually related to their mission type. Players can customize height and colors to make them unique, and as they level, they can add modifiers that adjust the way they play. Leveling up unlocks new &ldquo;slots&rdquo; that can have modifier chips added to them, adjusting percentages and numbers in various areas. These modifier chips are unlocked by completing missions and searching the environment. For example, players may want to specialize in jump height, adding small and large modifier chips into as many slots as possible.</p><p>There are definitely improvements to the&nbsp;<em>Jet Set Radio</em>&nbsp;formula here. As I mentioned, the controls work great, though the mission content is often lacking. You can spray-paint, but it amounts to clicking the mouse a lot over the area to paint -- no more mini-game. The style is there, but a bit faded compared to its inspiration. The anti-authoritarian vibe is also present, but it feels very forced due to the poor writing and general lack of plot emphasis. The couple of music tracks created by Naganuma are, of course, amazing, but it&#39;s not enough to carry the weight of the entire game on its back.</p><p><em>Hover</em>&nbsp;ends up as a game that&#39;s a blast to maneuver around and explore but becomes at odds with its own design. There are a lot of peculiar decisions that make everything much more frustrating than it needs to be.&nbsp;<em>Hover</em>&nbsp;is something I desperately wanted to fall in love with, and although I&rsquo;m happy to have been acquainted with it, we&rsquo;ll be headed our separate ways moving forward.</p>'),

It&rsquo;s a sci-fi RPG with an&nbsp;<em>XCOM</em>-derivative battle system derivative battle system that encourages smart use of every party member players take into each mission. Unfortunately, while its tactical combat is enjoyable, the rest of game is sadly not up to par, as an esoteric setting is joined by a lacklustre plot and abundant technical challenges.</p><p><em>Element: Space</em>&nbsp;takes place in a future where humanity has spread out across three different star systems, inhabiting planets and moons like Venus and Europa. These factions are somewhat bizarrely organised, with real-world regions getting their own planets rather than each world developing its own identity. Players control Captain Christopher Pietham, who is in charge of security at a new starship that&rsquo;s set to become the headquarters of the Galactic Congress. However, the ship is attacked ahead of its launch by shadowy organisation Tempest, who manage to put the blame on Pietham. Pietham, his superior, and an AI-controlled robot manage to escape and set out to expose Tempest&rsquo;s nefarious deeds.</p><p><em>Element: Space</em>&nbsp;has some decent character-focused story elements, particularly those missions where players recruit new party members, as well as their on-board events involving Pietham and other members. The overall plot is less interesting, and features a &ldquo;to be continued&rdquo; ending with the immediately preceding events being highly predictable. There&rsquo;s very little build up to that finale, as Pietham and his crew undertake an assortment of disconnected missions until suddenly the closing act appears after the 12-15 hour mark. There is a text-based epilogue reel based on how players&rsquo; relationships with other factions and their party members end up, but it offers very little in the way of closure.</p><p>The game&rsquo;s combat is pretty interesting, but let down by what surrounds it.</p><p>The turn-based tactical combat is easily the game&rsquo;s most engaging element. Each combatant gets a major and minor action, with attacking or using most skills requiring the former, while moving uses up the latter. There is lots of freedom to move around, as only certain weapons will automatically fire on anyone running within range, and setting up an overwatch requires forgoing an attack and is incredibly easily bypassed. This makes it a game of constantly moving around to flank and pick off enemies. Depending on how large it is, cover can prevent damage from certain directions or reduce the accuracy to 50%, but cover can also be destroyed in just two hits. Other than for not getting blasted from all sides, using cover is most useful for making enemies move around for their attacks, putting them in range to get flanked the next turn.</p><p>While perhaps not resulting in a realistic firefight, the constant movement means that it keeps players engaged and each turn always needs to be thought through. A good selection of potential abilities for Pietham and the eight party members that can be recruited provides plenty of options for players to utilise, many of which let the team work together, such as Zero&rsquo;s ability to destroy an enemy&rsquo;s shield or Alice&rsquo;s AoE and push-back attacks.</p><p>Though enjoyable and holding up on its own for the game&rsquo;s length, the combat system can get a bit repetitive. The primary method the game has for upping the challenge appears to be overwhelming the player by sending out more reinforcements. There are at least some slightly different win conditions other than the usual &ldquo;defeat everyone&rdquo; as well as a few different enemy types, which gives some slight variations to missions, though they usually require minor tactical adjustments rather than complete rethinks.</p><p>New party members are recruited by selecting and completing their story missions.</p><p>Sadly, the game is beset by technical problems, the least annoying of which are massive load times. Every lost fight immediately caused the game to freeze before any game over or retry message could be displayed. Meanwhile, combatants can suffer unknown issues that cause them to fail to attack, though this usually works in the player&rsquo;s favour. One particular combat ability also appeared to cause the game to freeze at a later turn. Thankfully, the autosave means that players generally only have to redo a single battle. Research indicates that such issues are not limited to the PlayStation 4 port this review is based on and are simply a fact of the game as it is now.</p><p>The game did not have voice acting for its initial PC launch, but it has been added for its console release, including on the PC version. The performances are not of the highest quality, but they certainly liven up the event scenes and give them some B-movie charm. They do showcase the game&rsquo;s visual limitations, however, as events back on the ship are fully voiced, but show the character models as unflinchingly static-mouthed while they generically rock around. Just leaving them as portraits while the voicing did the work would be less distracting. Combat and the arenas look decent enough, without anything hugely noteworthy.</p><p>Though the combat holds up, it&rsquo;s just too difficult to find a way to recommend&nbsp;<em>Element: Space&nbsp;</em>as a whole. There&rsquo;s not much of interest from a narrative standpoint, while all of the good points about the gameplay are offset by the technical problems. It&rsquo;s a shame, as there&rsquo;s a good base underneath it, but even with giving leeway based on the small size of the development team, the annoyances currently outweigh the good.</p>'),

Lovecraft&rsquo;s notebook, but it&rsquo;s also a mysterious place we have yet to fully conquer because of how deadly it is for our fleshy bodies to navigate. That sense of danger, mystique, and separation makes the ocean depths a prime setting for a horror game that few seem to take advantage of.&nbsp;<strong><em>NARCOSIS</em></strong>, a walking simulator-horror hybrid that takes place on the seafloor, attempts to realize this potential, but ends up drowning because of its flimsy scares, poor controls, and abhorrent visuals.</p><p>Despite those flaws,&nbsp;<em>Narcosis</em>&nbsp;is far more focused on its story than it may initially seem.

The story plays out in a series of non-diegetic monologues that slowly reveal themselves as something more as you progress.</p><p>Great voice acting and solid writing delve into such themes as survivor&rsquo;s guilt, isolation, fear, and other harrowing topics and push the story forward at a satisfying clip.

Strengthen your cards with the First Crush ❤ Rub mode, taking on a hands-on role to warm them up and gain more artwork!</p><p>Touch-a, touch-a, touch-a, touch me</p><p>Too often, unique and engaging games are passed over due to their risqu&eacute; content and gimmickry, and&nbsp;<em>Monster Monpiece</em>&nbsp;is inevitably one that will fall victim to this curse.</p><p>It&#39;s not difficult to see why some may be turned off by it, though -- despite the fact that it&#39;s a strategic card battler, it&#39;s also rife with many of the same tropes that will turn members of even its target audience off: like &quot;rubbing&quot; illustrations that happen to resemble young women and engaging in adult situations. But beneath the trappings of a fluffy &quot;adult&quot; game is a challenging and entertaining card game that&#39;s quite fun.</p><p>And believe it or not, that&#39;s actually the main attraction.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Monster Monpiece</em>&nbsp;is set in the magical world of Yafaniel, where there&#39;s a large dearth of male inhabitants. Human women befriend and train Monster Girls, which is where the card battles come in. Young May is a human who&#39;s trying to reach the rank her mother did as a powerful monster trainer, but on her journey to become one her friend Elza becomes one of the &quot;Lost.&quot; With Elza having succumbed to what&#39;s essentially zombification, May has to find a way to cure her before she takes control of the world&#39;s Magus Quartzes. While it&#39;s not exactly too original of a narrative, it sets a nice tone for the rest of the game, which definitely won&#39;t be what many are expecting.</p><p>Card battles are the heart of the affair, with players collecting hundreds of cards depicting hyper-sexualized versions of mythical creatures like minotaurs. Once you&rsquo;ve settled on a deck, you&rsquo;ll use it to send chibi versions of the monster girls to duke it out for supremacy. Battles play out on a 7x3 grid, where the player begins on the left side of the screen and advances toward the opponent on the right. Reaching your opponent&#39;s stronghold is the name of the game, which is done so by playing cards each turn in order to summon monster girls and take out your enemy&#39;s defenses.</p><p>Some cards come packing their own special sort of bonus, denoted by a marking on the card. These monster girls are good to go with additional buffs that you&#39;ll want to make use of every single time they come up in your deck. These buffs may be additional health points, another turn in battle, or they may bolster the damage done per turn. No matter the case, they&#39;re extremely useful and can turn the tide of battle in many ways.</p><p>Unfortunately, while battles are rewarding and scratch that itch for strategic card placement, there do tend to be entirely too many of them. It&#39;s not&nbsp;<em>Skies of Arcadia</em>-level bonkers as far as encounters go, but it can be extremely frustrating, especially if you haven&#39;t quite gotten the hang of how best to create decks to combat an onslaught of enemies. And even for those with an abundance of combat prowess, it&#39;s never fun to be thrust into battle every five minutes.</p><p>In all,<em>&nbsp;Monster Monpiece</em>&nbsp;looks and feels great, and I found myself spending hours on it when I should have stopped long ago to attend to more pressing matters -- something I never expected to happen with such an out-there premise. It simply shouldn&#39;t be taken at face value because the cards are &quot;too sexy&quot; or because there happens to be an overtly sexual minigame in which you rub your Vita&rsquo;s front and rear panels, which is actually&nbsp;<em>completely</em>&nbsp;optional.&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s an excellent addition to the niche library that has made its home on the Vita, and for $29.99, it&rsquo;s an intriguing card battler you won&rsquo;t find anywhere else. Ignore the taboos and give it a shot, especially if you&rsquo;re looking for something a little different than a dungeon crawler or traditional role-playing game. It&rsquo;ll thrill you, chill you, and fulfill you, creature of the night.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>'),

AP&#39;s remit is the USA&#39;s dirty work, and as a group they&#39;re free to be liquidated at will.Once acquainted with the team, it&#39;s off to Saudi Arabia for Thornton&#39;s first proper assignment. With a jumbo jet swatted from the sky by American missiles, apparently pilfered by terrorist group Al-Samad, Alpha Protocol sails close to the wind of believable modern topics. Big business is firmly in the game&#39;s sniper scope &ndash; fake hypercorporation Halbech is a constant in Thornton&#39;s quests: the weapons contractor that made the planewrecking rockets in the first place. Similarities to real companies like Halliburton are obviously no coincidence, and Halbech&#39;s influence throughout the world is, with an eye to spoilers, less than benign.</p><p>Come at the game like a pure shooter and Alpha Protocol is simplistic. Weapons have their own quirks: line up a pistol shot, and after a moment the reticule will turn red, giving a critical hit. Yank out a shotgun and you&#39;ll get a bonus for clearing a room, successive buckshot twatting foes with more force each blast. The problem is, such is the innate RPG-itude of the game, it&#39;s all too easy to mentally superimpose little numbers ticking away over your foe&#39;s heads.</p><p><strong>Missfire</strong></p><p>Considering the game takes pains to introduce your Thornton as a prodigy, it&#39;s confusing to work out quite why his myopia hasn&#39;t been diagnosed correctly on one of his company physicals. My Mike was a pistol specialist, having deliberately ramped up his shooting hand to off targets quickly. Great at 15 feet, where a headshot meant goodnight goon, but beyond that and he had the aim of a standard Bond henchman.There is some good in the floaty combat: an impressive weapon customisation system will, if the right elements are combined, let you upgrade guns and armour. Sidearms have four slots in which to cram technology &ndash; either bought from the &#39;Clearinghouse&#39; black market or nabbed on-mission &ndash; and these make a notable difference to a weapon&#39;s handling. Body armour can be purchased and then lined with various gadgets, boosts, or armour plates: want to be the spy world&#39;s Rambo? You can purchase clanky soldier armour, and stuff it full of ceramic pads to deflect bullets aimed for your vitals. I went a different route, pocketing a silencer for my handgun early on, and combining it with futuristic stealth armour that muffled any loud movements.Theoretically I had no protection against gunned-up guards who spotted me; realistically, my gameplan meant they never would. Thornton&#39;s background is selectable, the choice between soldier, spy or techy informing how far you can progress in certain skills. Plumping for the spy lifestyle, I had my action points pre-spent on the skills that&#39;d assist in my chosen approach, filling the stealth and close-combat areas of Thornton&#39;s character sheet.</p>'),

(180,	'<p>You rarely see this addressed in the great space operas, but the process of space travel can be boring. Sure, you might feel giddy when you see the Earth&rsquo;s curvature below you for the first time, and you can look forward to an obligatory existential crisis as the planet and then the sun become indistinguishable from all the other pinheads of pure white light in your perceived sphere of space, but what comes after that?</p><p>Maybe you start tiring of your functional metallic surroundings, designed to joylessly keep you alive. The dense bricks of space food will dull your taste buds within a week, and you may find that your crewmates&mdash;the people you&rsquo;re presumably going to share&nbsp;<em>the rest of your life</em>&nbsp;with&mdash;are a dissonant bunch that you have nothing in common with, making for an infinity of stilted conversations in the canteen.&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, and you&rsquo;ve just received word that there&rsquo;s another fungal bug infestation in the service tunnels. Well, better get to it then, seeing as you&rsquo;re not only the ship&rsquo;s captain, but also the only capable pest controller onboard.</p><p>That&rsquo;s the scenario of roguelike, first-person shooter and base-building game Genesis Alpha One&mdash;space opera without characters; space exploration without context.</p><p>Cosmic order</p><p>The constituent parts for something interesting are here though. You start out with a crew of human clones embarking on the Genesis project&mdash;a corporate-funded mission to find humanity a new home. Your perspective in the game is divided between controlling your crew captain in first-person, and building and expanding your spaceship on a 3D grid.</p><p>The cosmos is depicted through a procedurally-generated tile-based map, which you traverse using a simple turn-based screen from the bridge of your ship. When you reach galaxies, you touch down on planetary surfaces in search of resources and upgrades, use those to expand and upgrade your ship, assign tasks to your fellow clones, then beam the ship to different galaxies once you&rsquo;ve bled that system dry (and yes, what little story there is does allude to the classic &lsquo;space travel is the new colonialism&rsquo; platitude).</p><p>It&rsquo;s a logical and varied loop of activities, bolstered by the fact that the ship-building system is modular and accessible in a way that doesn&rsquo;t take you hours to get things done. You plonk down ready-made modules such as weapon workshops, research labs for making new clones, and greenhouses where you can grow plants that provide a biosphere for the various human-alien hybrids that&rsquo;ll eventually populate your ship.&nbsp;</p><p>You connect all this up using corridors, lifts, and eventually teleports, and can set up defensive measures like decontamination chambers, gun turrets and security gates in case any alien life gets onboard.</p><p>Next, you set your crew to automatically work in the various modules, but you need to be there in person a lot of the time to decide what they should be working on: which debris to mine using the Tractor Beam, which clones to create, and which weapons to build. You have to do a lot of running around to make sure everything is working efficiently, so it&#39;s best to make sure your ship is sensibly laid out.&nbsp;Then you can step back to watch robots carry resources from your harvester to the storage as your crew diligently perform their assigned tasks. There&rsquo;s a satisfaction to seeing everything running in a factory-line sort of way.</p><p>Your ship layout is important for safety reasons too, because when you beam in resources using the Tractor Beam, or send your hapless subordinates on expeditions without you, then hostile aliens can get onboard. The smaller ones are the real problem, crawling into service shafts running under each module to make nests, then nibbling away at nodes powering the rooms. If they get to the nodes under your reactors or greenhouses, you&rsquo;re screwed, so it&rsquo;s important that you can get to vital parts of your ship quickly when you have to.</p><p>In theory this should create harrowing sci-fi horror scenes as vital systems shut down and rooms de-pressurise to the sound of blaring alarms. In reality though, disaster is easy to avoid. Just set up several turrets around your tractor beam and in contiguous service tunnels and you&rsquo;re pretty much set for life. In order to get the kind of swarming Starship Troopers-like intensity you see in the trailer, you have to let it happen.</p><p>Larger aliens, meanwhile, aren&rsquo;t that much of a threat if you beam them in, because they can&rsquo;t get into the vital organs of your ship. Yes, they can knock off a few crew members, who seem utterly incapable of defending themselves, but given that the only progression system for your crew is to create new and improved ones, it&rsquo;s no big loss.</p><p>There&rsquo;s an imbalance in the challenge here. If things go wrong on your ship the disaster can escalate very quickly, but it&rsquo;s too easy to block off the avenues by which that can happen. My first run of Genesis Alpha One lasted about five minutes, as some space-mites got into my ship&rsquo;s underbelly, nibbled the nodes, and duly blew everything up. On my second run, a rudimentary, never-upgraded defensive setup ensured that I completed a good 10-hour run while rarely breaking sweat. With no depleting resources like fuel or food, you could almost forget this is a roguelike, because you&rsquo;re rarely forced into those high-stakes situations and dilemmas.</p><p>Poor man&#39;s sky</p><p>It doesn&#39;t even matter when you die. The game auto-assigns you another near-identical crew member when it happens. You&#39;re most likely to die during harvesting missions, where you land on procedurally generated planets to gather resources with up to two crew-mates. With the planets&rsquo; 70s sci-fi neon tones and synthy soundtrack, you could almost squint and mistake it for No Man&rsquo;s Sky.&nbsp;</p><p>What it actually is is a simple wave-survival segment where you harvest resources from within a few feet of your ship while enemies beam in to attack you. You can set up turrets and energy barriers, or take on your assailants using a weapons arsenal that expands as you research new techs and acquire new samples from fallen foes.&nbsp;</p><p>The shooting is as weightless as the flailing ragdolls of dead aliens, and the rhythm of these encounters is exactly the same each time, even if the aliens vary. Try to explore more than a couple of hundreds yards from your ship, and you hit a force-field.</p><p>The saving grace of these missions is that they feed back into your ship-building and research&mdash;the strongest part of the game. It&#39;s exciting to discover blueprints for new modules, weapons and suit upgrades in shipwrecks. When you find new aliens, you can splice their DNA with human DNA back on your ship. There&rsquo;s a mad-scientist joy to creating rock-monster-human hybrids in the clone lab, or seeing what comes out if you mix in some spider-alien DNA.</p><p>The statistical and visual differences between hybrids are limited however; each hybrid is essentially a mask wrapped around a human clone&rsquo;s silly featureless face. But at least it gives you little goals to aim for on a journey that often lacks urgency. If the atmosphere of a planet deemed worthy of settling is filled with, say, nitrous oxide, you may even consider methodically executing your existing human crew and replacing them with N2O-breathing hybrids.</p><p>Crew expendable</p><p>That&#39;s a cruel way to treat your crew, but they have so little character it&#39;s hard to care. The human clones look disconcertingly like Working Joes from Alien: Isolation, except instead of uttering darkly comical meme material while throttling you, they&rsquo;re just walking tutorial menus that describe the room you&rsquo;re standing in. You can build a canteen for crew who aren&rsquo;t assigned to tasks, but even there they bimble around listlessly with no needs or interactivity.</p><p>At one point, I shot a crew member, partly out of boredom, but also in the hope of getting human DNA samples for my cloning research. But I got nothing, and felt nothing. It&rsquo;s a stark contrast to similarly reticent people-management games like FTL and the&nbsp;<u>bizarre, brilliant Kenshi</u>, where the games&rsquo; clever systems help spark my imagination, encouraging me to mourn lost lives or otherwise weave characters&rsquo; deaths into a story.</p><p>The disparate parts of Genesis Alpha One actually fit together quite well, but none of them are high-quality parts. You can lose yourself for a while in designing your ship, giving its corridors a nice colour scheme, and tinkering with new DNA and alien abilities, but when you&rsquo;re done you still have to go back to those bland tasks alongside your bland colleagues. Where&rsquo;s my Working Joe to tell me everything&rsquo;s going to be OK as he smashes my brains out against the wall?</p>'),

(190,	'<p>About this game</p><p>March your army of monstrous creatures into chaotic battles in the epic action-strategy Total War: WARHAMMER II. With this Steam PC key, you&#39;ll decide the fate of the Great Vortex in the sequel to the fastest-selling Total War game.</p><p>The game focuses heavily on turn-based strategy and real-time tactics, expanding over five continents of the New World &ndash; Ulthuan, Naggaroth, The Southlands, Lustria and Nehekhara. Your playstyle, your method of conquering &ndash; take on the game&rsquo;s campaign or take the fight to fellow players and test your leadership skills and the strength of your army in online multiplayer matches.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>CHOOSE YOUR RACE</strong>&nbsp;<br />A Millennia ago, a council of High Elf mages forged a vast, arcane vortex to draw the Winds of Magic from the world as a sinkhole drains an ocean, and blast the Daemonic hordes back to the Realm of Chaos. Now the Great Vortex falters, and the world again stands at the brink of ruin.&nbsp;<br />While powerful forces try to avert catastrophe, others seek to harness the vortex&rsquo;s energies for their own bitter purpose. The race is on, and the very fate of the world will lie in the hands of the victor. Who will you choose: will it be Prince Tyrion, Defender of Ulthuan, and the High Elves as they desperately try to stabilise the vortex that is situated above their home continent &ndash; or maybe the Slann Mage-Priest Mazdamundi and his Lizardmen, who also seek to prevent cataclysm.&nbsp;<br />Perhaps you want to see the Great Vortex in the hands of an evil ruler, such as the Witch King Malekith and his sadistic Dark Elf hordes, who travel from Naggaroth and their labyrinthine Black Arks &ndash; or the rodent army of Skaven, led by Queek Headtaker, who stir in their foul subterranean tunnels awaiting any excuse to rise to the surface and become the dominant race.&nbsp;<br />Each of the four races in Total War: WARHAMMER II will be playable in single and multiplayer campaign, as well as custom and multiplayer battles. As the two Legendary Lords for each race all have their own unique campaign start positions, you&rsquo;ll be able to play a 2-player co-op campaign with the same race. If you own both parts 1 and 2, you&rsquo;ll be able to play in multiplayer as any of the races you own.&nbsp;<br />As one of the eight Legendary Lords featured in the four races from the Warhammer Fantasy Battles world, you must succeed in performing a series of powerful arcane rituals in order to stabilise or disrupt The Great Vortex depending on your race&rsquo;s main objective.&nbsp;<br />Better still, if you own both Total War: WARHAMMER and Total War: WARHAMMER II, you&rsquo;ll be able to use any of the races that you own in multiplayer modes &ndash; thanks to the Mortal Empires free DLC.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>WAR AND CONQUEST</strong>&nbsp;<br />Explore the New World as you engage in statecraft and diplomacy to help build your empire, turn by turn. Where words are not enough, you&rsquo;ll need to capture, build and manage settlements and recruit warriors to your armies. Legendary Lords and Heroes can be armed with mythical weapons and armour to lead your factions across the battlefield with great effect. Negotiate alliances or declare &lsquo;Total War&rsquo; against those who stand between you and your objective.&nbsp;<br />When it comes to battle, prepare for an intense and exhilarating experience as you command thousands-strong legions of soldiers in tactical conflict. Harness powerful magic and unleash hell as monsters descend on you and your enemies. Victory is not always achieved by charging into battle with a large army; players must also utilise military strategies and lay ambushes to help turn the tide of combat.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>EXPANSION</strong>&nbsp;<br /><strong>Rise of the Tomb Kings</strong>&nbsp;<br />Witness a new race rise from their desert graves and join the fight in the Rise of the Tomb Kings DLC expansion. The Tomb Kings do not seek to influence the Great Vortex, and therefore do not engage in the race for control of it &ndash; but they can be played in the Eye of the Vortex campaign. Instead, they seek the nine cursed Books of Nagash, a search culminating in an epic battle at the Black Pyramid of Nagash itself. Each book grants a special campaign bonus, moving the player closer to an overall victory.&nbsp;<br />Money is not desired by the Tomb Kings, but Canopic Jars certainly are. Use these jars to awaken powerful units, unlock techs, perform rites and to craft unique items in the Mortuary Cult. Take advantage of your undead army&rsquo;s ability to resurrect once more with The Realm of Souls. As more of your warriors fall in battle, the more souls enter the Realm. At three key thresholds, the Realm of Souls triggers a mass healing-wave among your skeletal units, each wave becoming successively more powerful.&nbsp;<br />After the final wave, the player also gains an army ability allowing them to summon a unit of mighty Ushabti on the battlefield.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Blood for the Blood God II</strong>&nbsp;<br />Add gore and horror to your WARHAMMER II battle experiences with the Blood for the Blood God II DLC expansion. Through the game&rsquo;s Advanced Graphics Settings, players will witness blood spurts and gory spatter on unit models, limb and head dismemberment for humanoids and non-legendary characters and blood-drenched UI elements &ndash; as well as explosive gibbing from deadly mid-torso strikes, random global campaign events that generate greater carnage in battle, and the ability for zombies and skeletons to continue to fight after dismemberment.</p><p><strong>Curse of the Vampire Coast</strong><br />It&#39;s a vampire pirates&#39; life for you in the frightening action-packed expansion Total War: WARHAMMER II - Curse of the Vampire Coast. Players will command towering constructs, ghastly pincered sea-beasts, ghoulish horrors and musket-wielding piratical zombie hordes in battle.</p><p>Only one who wields the Star-Metal Harpoon will tame the great Merwyrm Amanar, and become immune to its ravenous hunger. Find the Harpoon and invigorate the beast using the three verses of a secret, ancient sea-shanty.<br /><br /><strong>YOUR OFFICIAL TOTAL WAR: WARHAMMER II STEAM PC KEY GIVES YOU:</strong></p><ul><li>Epic large-scale battles in campaign and multiplayer modes.</li><li>Detailed maps, armies and effects throughout.</li><li>Average playtime value of 72 hours!</li></ul>'),

Assistant Deputy Director Shane Dickson enlists Ben McCall, along with FBI agent Kimberly Evans and DEA agent Eddie Guerra to track down the culprits, with the Mendoza Cartel and Antonio Alvarez as prime suspects. She informs them of the late Patrick Stone, who was investigating the Cartel up until his death in the bombing. They are also tasked with protecting Stone&#39;s only daughter, Jessica, a key informant in the investigation, whom they place under witness protection. Kim reveals that the Cartel has been purchasing military-grade hardware from an unknown source.</p><p>The trio proceeds to strike at the Cartel through their distributors&mdash;domestic street gangs, such as Ara&ntilde;a and the Rolling 50&rsquo;s, and clash in skirmishes with Ara&ntilde;a&#39;s rivals, the Vatos Locos. The team burn cannabis fields, raid a gang house, disrupt a sex trafficking ring (which also was housing shipments of cannabis), and intercept a large shipment of cash following an extensive car chase and gunfight.</p><p>At Eddie&#39;s behest, the team decides to move Jessica to a different safe house across the city in a car driven by one Sergeant Dempsey.

(235,	'<p>Last year, visual novel publisher MoeNovel came out of the woodwork to release&nbsp;<em>LoveKami -Divinity Stage-</em>&nbsp;on Steam. As the English-language publishing branch of Pulltop, it only made sense to expect them to bring more of the LoveKami series westward after that point. That&rsquo;s exactly what happened and now&nbsp;<em>LoveKami -Useless Goddess-&nbsp;</em>is available for PC gamers. There are a few things to note about this release. Despite sharing the series namesake, it&rsquo;s not in any way a direct sequel to<em>&nbsp;-Divinity Stage-</em>. Basically, folks should view them as in the same universe. Both games feature a world where goddesses have come to Japan and are now living among the populace.</p><p>While the previous LoveKami focused on goddesses who were working toward becoming idols, this tale mostly eschews the whole idol thing. This visual novel also moves the setting from the Akihabara district into a sleepy small town named Kannagi. Well, it had been until recently. Lately, the city is constantly suffering from power outages and nobody seems to know why. Our protagonist Sho discovers the root cause when simply walking home one night from a convenience store. There he meets a woman with electrical powers &ndash; a goddess in fact &ndash; named Akane. The only problem is that she&rsquo;s not able to control her own power, leading to continuous power outages whenever she gets emotionally charged. Goddesses who harm humans in any way are known as Aragami and simply aren&rsquo;t welcome in society.</p><p>Akane&rsquo;s guardian Inori appears and explains the situation&rsquo;s severity to Sho as well as his landlord and childhood friend, Maika. If Akane can&rsquo;t reign in her power and become a good goddess then she&rsquo;ll be relegated to become a spirit which no longer manifests in the real world. She won&rsquo;t die, but it&rsquo;s a pretty similar result. In a fateful twist it also happens that Akane is the household goddess of the apartment where Sho lives. This is probably the most ridiculous aspect of the storyline but just run with it. If she disappears then the apartments will be left without care and apparently end up demolished. With both these facts weighing on his mind, Sho decides to take Akane&rsquo;s rehabilitation into his own hands.</p><p>Thus begins a goddess-tinged slice of life tale with your expected dose of hijinks. With Sho being the only male in attendance, he&rsquo;s regularly treated to fanservice between the trio of gals. He doesn&rsquo;t (usually) revel in it, though, and tries to focus on the tasks at hand. Despite everyone doing their best to help Akane along her way she stumbles at times, leading to very light drama in the storyline. At about halfway through, an innocuous-seeming choice appears on screen. Visual novel fans will recognize this three-pronged dialogue option as pushing you down one of three routes: Akane, Inori or Maika. This is the only option in the game. So while it&rsquo;s not a total kinetic novel, it&rsquo;s pretty close to one.</p><p>Each path focuses on the human or goddess you&rsquo;ve chosen and still features a handful of overlapping scenes between each. There&rsquo;s no real set order to the routes so opt for whichever character you like most first. With that said, it does appear that one ending could lead into a sequel to<em>&nbsp;LoveKami -Useless Goddess-</em>&nbsp;with incredible ease. It&rsquo;s just such a perfect setup! Even after completing each route you won&rsquo;t rack up that much additional time. A complete playthrough should last anywhere from two to five hours, depending on your reading speed. It&rsquo;s also important to note that this game was never available as an 18+ release. While some scenes are superbly sexual, they have never and presumably will never lead to any actual adult content.</p><p>As with most other visual novels,&nbsp;<em>LoveKami -Useless Goddess-&nbsp;</em>offers full voice acting for its female cast and leaves the protagonist without one. The Japanese voice acting leaves little room for complaint. The E-Mote Engine sprites actually look rather tame in this game instead of bouncing about every which way. You&rsquo;ll also find a decent handful of CG sequences with high quality anime artwork. Still, it&rsquo;s easier to assemble these aspects when the core game is as short as it is.</p><p>Although the writing is free of glaring typos, it does leave something to be desired. Most of the conversations come across in an &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard this all before&rdquo; fashion. Even the colorful tale of wayward goddesses isn&rsquo;t able to make dialogue terribly interesting. It also feels like the other characters lose all importance once you start down a specific route. Then that relationship becomes the only thing worth caring about which is quite the distressing statement for the narrative to make. Sure, young love is great, but don&rsquo;t lose sight of your friends. Apparently things are different once goddesses get involved in the picture.</p><p><strong><em>Closing Comments:</em></strong></p><p>If you enjoyed&nbsp;<em>LoveKami -Divinity Stage-</em>&nbsp;then you may also dig this game. It just depends&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;you were enamored with the previous title. Those who were really into the whole idol aspect will find little in this narrative to hook them (beyond a very brief segment). If you just love this take on Japan where goddesses are klutzy, naughty and paradoxically naive then this visual novel should still be up your alley. There&rsquo;s not a lot of deep storytelling or character development, but<em>&nbsp;LoveKami -Useless Goddess-</em>&nbsp;should satisfy folks looking to perk up a drab afternoon.</p>'),

(248,	'<p>AMPLITUDE Studios has started 2019 strong with a string of surprise expansion releases. At this point, I would argue that&nbsp;<em>Endless Legend</em>&nbsp;is easily worthy of a top five position amongst its 4X strategy brethren. Its newest (and final) expansion,&nbsp;<em>Symbiosis</em>, lends itself well to helping the core game stand amongst industry giants, literally. Unless you have a giant phobia of skyscraper sized insectoids, in which case maybe you should sit this one out.</p><p>Candidly,&nbsp;<em>Symbiosis</em>&nbsp;is an amalgamation of fixing everything I dislike about single city civilizations and what I wish the&nbsp;Guardians from prior expansions&nbsp;were. Which is to say, just because the newest playable race doesn&rsquo;t dance to my preferred rhythm doesn&rsquo;t mean you should pass up this expansion. If you enjoy being a war-monger, having exploration be a core part of your overall strategy, or like the simplicity of only having to build something once, then the Mykara are going to be your jam.</p><p>The Mykara are all about evolution and assimilation, entirely through conquest. They cannot settle into new regions, instead opting to build Fungal Blooms on top of ruins, temples, extractors, pacified minor faction villages, you name it. Likewise, they don&rsquo;t obtain new cities through conquest, instead turning them into fungal ghost towns that eventually yield a certain amount of their previous FIDSI total (Food, Industry, Science, Dust, and Influence) and special bonus traits for the Mykara, depending on what race previously owned that city. For example, conquering Vaulters gives a bonus to science output and some winter immunity. The Broken Lords give an increased Dust output and Health Regeneration based on how many villages you have pacified.</p><p>Meanwhile, your capital city begins to blossom from all these external resources. Production pre-planning becomes critical given you cannot produce or build anywhere else. Luckily, Fungal Blooms are built with Food, completely independent of your Production Queue. As a result, the Mykara benefit immensely from early exploration of nearby resources and ruins, given they do not need to &ldquo;own&rdquo; the region in order to build Fungal Blooms. In the early game, most enemy civilizations will reach out saying they don&rsquo;t wish to upset you by destroying your blooms. Later, you can expect minor and major enemies to actively try to sabotage your resource income, especially if you have built far away from a defensible location. Good thing for the Mykara, anywhere can be a defensible location.</p><p>You see, Fungal Blooms built on top of Ruins turn into fast-travel locations exclusively for the Mykara. It becomes very easy to focus on Food Output and exponentially build up a vast network of locations, effectively making Auriga your own personal subway system. All the while, you are most likely the first to visit numerous regions across the globe given your exploration focus, exploiting their various rewards and resources before other empires can claim them. It&rsquo;s a huge win-win scenario, and it makes conquest significantly more feasible for a single-city civilization. Again, the only downside being you only truly have one city, so progression is going to feel extremely linear until you start being able to afford multiple standing armies. Not to mention, you shouldn&rsquo;t recklessly leave your dominated cities undefended! As long as you are smart about staying on top of watching your regions borders (unlike me), you can &ldquo;grow&rdquo; to your heart&rsquo;s content.</p><p>Apart from the Mykara, Symbiosis also introduces us to the Urkan. These massive insectoid beasts will appear randomly around the map, completely taking control of neutral regions of land. Players can choose to either appease the Urkan with bribes, slowly winning them over to their side, or defeating them in battle and enslaving them to their cause. It is worth noting that Urkans are extremely strong, especially against early-game armies. Unlike Guardians, who roam as solitary units and suffer increasingly from a single action economy, the Urkan store numerous lice armies inside of them. These high-attack minions will jut out of the Urkan&rsquo;s massive orifices and defend their tremendous masters whenever needed. They may even run rampant and attack undefended locations if left to their own devices for too long.</p><p>In addition, the real reason why the Urkan fascinate me is because of their resource bonuses and dedicated tech tree! Urkan, when domesticated, can sit within neighboring neutral lands and effectively extract the resources for your empire remotely. In addition, at the cost of giving up Luxury Resources, you can upgrade your Urkan to give massive percentage bonuses to your various city outputs. We&rsquo;re talking a flat 20% increase to all Dust income and 50 Approval rating at the same time, just for existing next door, as an example. Likewise, you can settle an Urkan right at your enemy neighbor&rsquo;s border, making that region temporarily yours, which means you can retrofit your armies to your newest available technologies right as you&rsquo;re about to lay the smackdown. Each Urkan is unique from its brothers, offering specific bonuses to offensive and defensive playstyles, which means different civilizations and players may focus on capturing different Urkans first.</p><p>Should you manage to domestic all three Urkan, you can unlock Coordinated Tremors. At that point, honestly things just become silly, as you can watch three giant Kaiju bugs rein chaos from anywhere within an opponent&rsquo;s territory. City sieges become laughably easy, which blends well with the Mykara&rsquo;s pursuits of dominance by force. Notably, the Mykara do have race-unique researches that allow them to better benefit from Urkan domestication, like the ability to garrison friendly units inside of Urkans. Did I mention that like the Mykara, Urkans can burrow to any visible location as long as it is unowned by any empire? Guardians, eat your heart out.</p><p>Overall,&nbsp;<em>Symbiosis</em>&nbsp;does a good job of taking a pre-existing 4X strategy trope, the single-city civilization, and spicing it up with unique mechanics. Offering fast travel as soon as you have Fungal Blooms built atop ruins makes the Mykara into terrifying shocktroopers, while also making exploration around the globe meaningful and more rewarding towards your overall strategy.

(251,	'<p>Iris.Fall is a puzzle adventure game featuring striking visuals and a spellbinding theme of &quot;light and shadow&quot;.</p><p>I can&rsquo;t confirm whether or not &ldquo;Iris&rdquo; is the name of the player-controlled character or just a play on words about optics, and I can only postulate that &ldquo;Fall&rdquo; refers to your figurative tumble down a rabbit hole. Furthermore, I have no answer for why there is a period wedged between the two words. Unorthodox as its title may be, however, fledgling Chinese developer NEXT Studios&rsquo;&nbsp;<em>Iris.Fall</em>&nbsp;is actually a rather conventional linear puzzler. At least, fundamentally. Enter an area and expect an environmental puzzle or two to solve before progressing to the next challenges, and so forth. Procuring an inventory of key items to be used on the spot is also part and parcel of your journey. Nonetheless, there are a few gimmicks involving light and shadow that cast an engaging array of puzzle designs upon a dreamy and pleasantly old-fashioned setting.</p><p>For the sake of convenience, let&rsquo;s go ahead and call the protagonist Iris. So, after waking from a nightmare in an introductory cinematic, Iris catches notice of a black cat in her room, practically beckoning her out of bed. She follows as it absconds into the night and the empty streets, and finally into a derelict theater. Within, she peers down a crumbled stairway where an unnatural wind blows upward, corroding the walls and literally draining the color from her body. From here on the only spots of color come from the yellow beams of artificial light and occasional accents of blue. Without uttering a word or applying text,&nbsp;<em>Iris.Fall</em>&nbsp;tells the rest of its story &ndash; what vague story there is &ndash; through succinct cinematics involving puppets and people who seem to solely exist in shadows, as rife with metaphor as that sounds. Clearly, the developer wants you to surmise your own conclusions as you press onward into the fantastical, loosely connected steampunk-inspired rooms beneath the theater. What is your objective? Well, it seems you&rsquo;re just following the cat until the slightly predictable plot revelation at the end.</p><p>From a fixed perspective, the camera tracks Iris automatically but allows you three-dimensional movement. Character speed is a tad slow, but since walking from one obstacle to the next usually takes very little time, and many puzzles lock you into their own systems, this rarely feels like an issue. Environments are fairly cramped anyway, with exploration being a non-factor. Players are given the choice of keyboard and mouse or gamepad controls, and both control methods felt comfortable to me, the only distinction between them being that the former requires you to click on things such as the bag icon in the corner of the screen to open your inventory, as well as the eye icon that displays when within range of interactive hotspots, while the latter simplifies things a bit by assigning these commands to the press of buttons.</p><p>Right from the top of those first impassable stairs, you are immediately introduced to the principal mechanic, that of fusing Iris with her own shadow. Come across a strategically placed open book on the floor and interact with it to make your transition &ndash; just don&rsquo;t hold out for any narrative justification of why this is possible. In shadow form, you will reach places otherwise inaccessible by sliding across the flat surface of walls and treading on the shadows of other objects from the foreground. It&rsquo;s an excellent gimmick, though not entirely unique, bearing an unmistakable resemblance to a major feature of such titles as&nbsp;<em>Contrast</em>,&nbsp;<em>Lost in Shadow</em>, and&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds</em>. Even so, the execution here differs enough that I wouldn&rsquo;t resort to such a belittling term as &ldquo;knockoff.&rdquo; I do wish there was more flexibility in the implementation of this mechanic though, since it can only be activated at predetermined locations.</p><p>Even so, the shadow-based puzzles offer a decent range, whether building a bridge made of shadow for you to cross via placeable objects and moveable platforms, or fitting shadows within an outline by determining the proper distance to place items from a light source. Not leaning too heavily on these tricks,&nbsp;<em>Iris.Fall</em>&nbsp;has plenty more in its bag as well. You will find yourself confronting such objectives as spinning a row of pictographs like a combination lock to find the set that creates a continuous mural; flipping around a series of staircases with levers in a section reminiscent of the mind-bending art of M.C. Escher; and directing beams of light between doors to link them, thus allowing you to warp from one to the other and arrive at different floors. One particular puzzle reminds me of a slider the way it expects you to think one step ahead while shifting pieces on a board. As someone who has never found enjoyment in slide puzzles, this was a sticking point for me, but considering this is the only substantial gripe I have in this area, I&rsquo;d say the game does an excellent job of instituting diverse and interesting scenarios while slowly increasing the difficulty.</p><p>You are able to toggle hints on or off in the settings, although the only difference I noticed is that when switched on a small (sometimes imperceptible) white dot hovers over points of interest. In other words, hints have no bearing on assisting with puzzle solutions but instead potentially prevent the need for pixel hunting. As with any puzzle-oriented game, how long it takes to finish will vary greatly, but anticipate about two hours of play time. Aside from starting the game from scratch, completed chapters are individually selectable from the title screen for your convenience, though there are no collectibles or alternate solutions a second time through that particularly warrant a replay.</p><p>The presentation of&nbsp;<em>Iris.Fall</em>&nbsp;is arguably its strongest asset, at once drawing visual inspiration from puppet shows and illustrated storybooks. Basically, it&rsquo;s a mishmash of childhood storytelling aesthetics with a comparable kind of wonder and fantasy that excites the mind, realized through a blend of hand-drawn 2D backdrops and 3D environments. Sometimes entering a new section is like the unexplainable shift between one dream and the next; the standout moment for me would have to be when I was dropped into the pages of a pop-up book. Yet no matter where you find yourself, the world is a spectacle of antiquated architecture and d&eacute;cor, with the most advanced machinery being composed of wood, stone, and clockwork gears. The choice of (mostly) monochromatic visuals as well as vignetting during cutscenes lends a quaintness that&rsquo;s exquisitely matched by the application of piano, accordion, and music box songs.</p><p>It&rsquo;s unlikely that you will feel any emotional connection to Iris by the end<strong>,</strong>&nbsp;but the concept of puppetry ties the presentation and gameplay together in a gratifying way. There are hardly any other characters in the game, and apart from the young protagonist the cat is the only other one to get dedicated screen time. Attention to little details is what breathes life into the experience, like where the feline clambers about rooms and chases shadows. Passing close enough to certain objects might trigger some sort of reaction, such as accidentally knocking over buckets of coal. The most pronounced instance I encountered was when Iris decided to sit and bounce on the edge of a bed when I approached it. Of course, I would have welcomed more of these moments, but the fact that they are present at all is admirable.</p><p>The final sequence of puzzles proved too easily overcome to induce a properly weighty climax, leaving me a bit surprised that it was over. Adding to this reaction, I believe the emphasis on light and shadow mechanics ends up feeling overly straightforward without reaching its fullest potential. Still, even if the execution just misses the mark at times, it lands far more often. If puzzle-heavy gameplay is your kind of thing, then rest assured you will get your fill from&nbsp;<em>Iris.Fall</em>&nbsp;and likely come out of the experience pleased by the assortment, and I imagine the delightful visuals will satisfy you most of all.</p>'),

(255,	'<p>It begins with a plea for help. A close up on a teenage girl&#39;s panicked face, clandestinely whispering about being &ldquo;erased.&quot; Her name is Hope. You don&#39;t know why she&#39;s called you. You can&#39;t quite tell where she is. But you know she&#39;s frightened, and everything is horribly wrong. We know this not because some omniscient narrator fills us in on the world in Republique&#39;s opening scene but in the same way you get all your information in Republique, a way that few games offer: you observe. You explore.The truth about Hope&#39;s new surroundings is out there, on the walls, in the newspapers, on the voicemails scattered around the game. A foreboding &ldquo;headmaster&rdquo; sees all, assuring an unseen populace that all is still right with the world--except clearly it isn&#39;t.</p><p>You&#39;re surrounded by guards, people are blathering on about manifestos, the dangers of information, and about the poisonous influence of a dead rebel named Daniel Zager, who sets the tone at the game&#39;s outset with a single quote: &ldquo;I used to be angry at my government because I thought they weren&#39;t listening. Now I&#39;m angry because I know they are.&rdquo; We are in a world of lavish accommodations, a place that more resembles Xavier&#39;s School for the Gifted than any sort of prison, and yet all the other telltale signs of a stone cold prison are inescapable, and in full view.</p><p>And so begins Republique, with a sense of supreme disquiet, and a constant, ongoing bewilderment. It&#39;s that bewilderment that drives the game onward and what keeps players guessing episode after episode through a mystery that&#39;s all too reticent to hand out the easy answers.</p><p>The dystopian nightmare is a compelling veneer for a rather simple stealth game when it comes down to brass tacks, though. Once you break Hope out of her initial confinement cell, your task is simply to keep her out of the hands of the Prizrak, the private security stooges milling about, keeping Pre-Cals&mdash;that is, the children of Republique&mdash;in their place, locked up, and under control. You do this by hijacking the thousands of surveillance devices scattered around the place, Watch Dogs style, and guide Hope from hiding place to hiding place, just beyond the sight of the Prizrak, hacking every piece of electronics you can find, occasionally managing to improve your door access in the process. Republique&#39;s lineage shows here. Developer Camouflaj has a few Metal Gear Solid veterans working under its roof, and that game&#39;s stealth pedigree shows in the patrol patterns, Hope&#39;s hiding spots, and the more advanced reactions when the Prizrak spot Hope and give chase.</p><p>The difference is that Hope doesn&#39;t have Snake&#39;s arsenal&mdash;or anything much at all really. Hope can pick up pepper spray, tasers, and a landmine that puts Prizrak to sleep. She can even pickpocket from the Prisrak if she&#39;s clever. But for every item Hope picks up to just barely fend off being caught, the Prizrak get taser-proof armor and nerve gas. It&#39;s in character for the game at least, since Hope is definitely shown to be a na&iuml;ve character who wouldn&#39;t know anything about the subtle arts of murder and persuasion. But it means often feeling like Hope is hideously outnumbered and outgunned.</p><p>Or at least it would if getting caught meant death, or punishment, or higher security. Instead, losing means getting marched hands-up to the nearest confinement cell (which are, essentially, the game&#39;s save rooms), waiting for the guard to leave so you can bust Hope out. For a place that seemingly wants Hope dead, and has no problem with putting the boots to anyone who disobeys, they seem to handle Hope the way you would a bratty 4 year old, and it works every time. It doesn&#39;t make sneaking any less fun, and arguably, the infinite retries are often a blessing, considering the amount of backtracking you already have to do, but it does mess with the game&#39;s immersion.</p><p>Indeed, breaking the hypnotic, curious spell the game can cast when its doling out more of the mystery is its biggest problem. Ironically, the Playstation 4 version&rsquo;s greatest technical success lends a hand to its greatest failure. The mobile and PC ports strictly kept the player as an omniscient voyeur, whose all-seeing eye jumped around the facility, whose touch/cursor led Hope every step of the way to freedom. For PS4, the game&rsquo;s interface has been heavily redesigned to take full advantage of the DualShock4, with camera jumps now context sensitive, with buttons assigned to elements in the environment, Mark of Kri-style.</p><p>This also allows the player full control over Hope using the left analog stick instead of just pointing her to the next location. On the positive side, except for an occasional stickiness when leaving cover, Hope&rsquo;s movements are appropriately responsive and simple to latch onto, making stealth all the more intuitive. The problem is the dissonance that comes with now being in full control over someone who still consistently asks for your assistance during gameplay--it essentially robs her of hard-won agency in the process.</p><p>The hits to immersion don&#39;t stop there. When jumping from camera to camera, you have the ability to read detailed files on each of the guards, which would be a nifty touch, one that pays off in spades in the third episode, if not for the fact that most of the guards&#39; files have a giant &ldquo;Kickstarter backer&rdquo; stamp under their country&#39;s flag, and often references their gamer identities. Early on, you start getting additional assistance from another Prizrak guard who calls and offers advice and information in emojis and a robotic voice. He&#39;s a strong character, whose role in the facility gets pieced together bit by bit, and who just so happens to have floppy disks referencing fellow indie developers and Playstation exclusives scattered all around the place as collectables. The game certainly has supporters in high places who deserve their tips of the hat, but placing those smirking nods so shortly after Hope sees her first dead body, or after watching Republique&#39;s media branch destroy a man&#39;s reputation feels wholly out of place.</p><p>It&#39;s only a stumbling block considering how great of a job the game does in world-building for such extended periods of time. For most of Republique, our eyes and ears are just as innocent as Hope&#39;s, and every new room is ripe with opportunities to learn something new, to fit a new piece of the puzzle on what we know about the Headmaster&#39;s plans and ambitions, the rampant, terrifying censorship and moralizing, the journalism-turned-propaganda-machine the failed, hostile attempts by Republique brass to engage the leaders of the free world. The stellar voice cast keeps us engaged from minute one, with every hackable device giving us brief, audio-only glimpses of the outside world and Republique&#39;s black-hat inner workings.</p><p>At the center of it all, literally, and metaphorically, there&#39;s just Hope: a frightened girl who just wants to see the world outside Republique, not realizing just what kind of world she&rsquo;s trying to work her way back into. She definitely finds out through the course of Republique&rsquo;s five episodes. It&#39;s worrisome stuff that threatens to absolutely ruin a girl who we&#39;re already forced to tread lightly with in the early going. One of the few moral choices in the game involves that very idea, of how much Hope can bear. Though Episode 4 is a disappointing regression to point-and-click adventure game ideas that have long been rendered obsolete, the answers are abundant, frightening, and more than a little on the ambitious side when the game comes to its climax. Its pedigree as the offspring of Metal Gear Solid veterans is never so pronounced as it is when Republique crescendos, and it more than outshines the relative coyness of the first three episodes. Where Republique&#39;s gameplay is satisfyingly simple, the plot driving it on is anything but.</p><p>Needless to say, despite its mobile game roots, the world of Republique is meant to immerse, to beckon the player&#39;s curiosity, and to involve them enough in the city-state&#39;s ins and outs enough to get Hope out of danger. In transitioning to consoles, the game remains largely successful at that.</p>'),

(257,	'<p>I love fighting games. The genre has fostered such a passion in me that I buy fighting games to support the scene and familiarize myself with titles, so I can discuss them at tournaments or on streams. For a while, the Lab Zero Games-developed Skullgirls&mdash;a 2D, team-based fighting game&mdash;was a game I watched regularly, but I didn&#39;t get into it due to lack of interest in the original roster. That changed with the release of Skullgirls 2nd Encore, a $14.99 upgrade to the base $9.99 game. It contains the two wonderful new characters that pulled me into the game, Beowulf and Big Band, three other combatants, a fully voiced story mode, a new survival mode, and fresh challenges, trials, and character colors. For $25, Skullgirls Second Encore is packed with value and content, and really puts&nbsp;Street Fighter V&nbsp;($18.30 at Amazon)&nbsp;, a full-priced game with a $30 season pass, to shame. Skullgirls is a&nbsp;PC game, but it&#39;s also available on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live.</p><p><strong>Learning From Your Elders</strong><br />Skullgirls takes cues from many highly regarded fighting game series. The team-based fighting utilizes a Capcom vs. SNK-style ratio system that lets you select up to three characters to battle up to three rival characters. This means you can choose two characters to go against three characters, or even one character against two. The ratio system balances the action by awarding damage and health points bonuses to teams with fewer combatants than their opponent&#39;s. For example, when the teams are not even, squads of three have 100 percent health and damage. Teams of two receive a 115 percent health and 130 percent damage boost. A one-fighter team has 205 percent health and 150 percent damage. If the number of fighters is the same on each team, it&#39;s a wash.</p><p>It would be wise for beginners to master one character before moving onto team play, but there&#39;s a benefit to having more than one fighter on your squad: assists.

(259,	'<p>Space Run Galaxy is the sequel to Space Run, the game from one-man studio Passtech, which seduced hundreds of thousands of players with its dynamic and original gameplay. By twisting the tower-defense game style, Space Run offered an addictive real-time spaceship construction strategy experience.</p><p>Long-haul trucking heads to the stars with Space Run Galaxy, a mix of tower-defense strategizing and twitchy arcade action that is surprisingly engrossing. It features a great deal of depth and compelling gameplay that challenges both your brain and your fingers. Broadly speaking, it&#39;s a game about running cargo from point A to point B--and sometimes point C or more, since some jobs take you to multiple star systems. You might go to places with names like Station K-2001 and Ceti Station instead of Indianapolis and Boise, and you might haul radioactive barrels and genetic decoders instead of frozen foods and car tires, but the focus here is still all about making deliveries on time with your cargo intact.</p><p>There are a few key complications, however. Ships in Space Run Galaxy are all built with modular hexes, and you&#39;re free to configure them as you wish. Make some cash from your runs and you can add to the basic vessel layout, improving your ship in several ways. You can haul more cargo, outfit your ride with more weapons, add high-tech gadgets like shields and repair units, or install more thrusters for greater speed. All of these add-ons--which are divided into four self-explanatory categories of Offensive, Defensive, Utilities, and Basic--can be purchased from a mechanic when you are planetside for both credits and materials specifically slotted into each of those categories. However, they can only be installed during missions.</p><p>This adds a sizable tactical layer to the game. As you are always dealing with a limited number of credits and materials, you have to make tough decisions between assignments. Do I go offensive by adding another laser cannon or a missile launcher to my stock? Do I increase the size of my vessel to haul more cargo and install more thrusters for speed? Do I go defensive with another shield or repair unit? The tech tree isn&rsquo;t spectacularly large or complex, but it offers enough choice to keep you intrigued and constantly customizing your ship to meet the demands of the spacelanes.</p><p>Said demands can be quite grueling, too. Unlike the average trucker on Earth, who faces hazards like tire blow-outs and the lure of wasting too much time in Denny&rsquo;s, every route in Space Run Galaxy is strewn with asteroids, murderous pirates, and potentially hostile aliens. Even though your ship basically runs on a pre-determined path during each run, there is a lot of action here as you build the aforementioned weapons, shields, thrusters, and so forth to address threats.</p><p>Incoming bad guys, space rocks, and the like are depicted on the main screen along with a meter that shows which way they are coming from and how long you have until the threats are upon you. This makes for some white-knuckle rides, as you need to make sure that your ship is well-equipped to deal with these problems in advance. While you may start a mission with a measured approach--dropping in a laser cannon here and a shield generator there--very soon you&rsquo;re scrambling to meet increasing threats as they slowly slide into range and start wrecking your vessel.</p><p>There is no pause button, so everything has to be tackled in real time. Hexnuts--the game&#39;s form of currency--always seem in short supply, which means you have to be really careful with what hardware you choose to install or else you run the risk of being defenseless when a bunch of enemy drones show up. Speed is also a big concern. Every mission must be completed before a timer expires, and you&#39;ll need to combat this by adding thrusters to your ship. Of course, this forces you to engage in a balancing act between prioritizing offense and defense as the limited number of hexnuts makes it very difficult to cover all of those bases and keep up your need for speed.</p><p>About the only drawbacks here are repetition and occasionally wonky difficulty. Every mission takes you back to the drawing board with a clean ship that needs a fresh install of all weapons and gear. This is unavoidable given the core design of the game, although it still forces you to endure repeat actions with every assignment.</p><p>Difficulty is more hit-and-miss than a steady progression, due to what seems to be a big disparity between story missions and respawning basic cargo runs. You can do one easy haul after another, then run into a brick wall of an insane job where you get confronted by multiple enemy gunships or aliens that cut you to ribbons. This actually increases the sense of repetition, as you need to grind out a lot of these basic cargo runs to earn the credits and goodies that are needed to upgrade your ship into a killer vessel able to handle such enemies. Missions are speedy, though, so you never feel like the game is dragging. The game has a real &ldquo;just one more turn&rdquo; vibe.</p><p>Multiplayer is incorporated here to provide the feel of an expanded universe. This is an interesting idea, clearly based on the appeal of setting up a full market system for players where they can interact, sell and buy goods, and even help one another out with delivery runs. That said, multiplayer seems to exist right now mainly as a way to pick up the odd run for extra credits or equipment. And since many missions allow you unlimited respawns, there isn&#39;t any real reason to take on these multiplayer offers unless you happen to be going in the right direction and have the room for a little extra cargo.</p><p>Even though it&#39;s repetitive and occasionally frustrating, Space Run Galaxy is a great way to, as Deep Purple puts it, &ldquo;go space truckin&rsquo; round the stars.&rdquo; Tactical depth, a wide range of choices when it comes to customizing your ships, and a liberal dose of frantic action during cargo runs--not to mention a good sense of humor and attractively cartoony visuals--combines to deliver an experience that isn&#39;t easy to master, but one that&#39;s worth the extra effort.</p>'),

(263,	'<p>Starfighter Origins is an Original 90`s style Indie space combat simulator Based on the CDF Universe. Combining a focus on single player action and a campaign story mode, Starfighter Origins offer fun and diverse gameplay. Designed for keyboard and mouse with full controller support.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know where to start with&nbsp;<em>Starfighter Origins</em>&nbsp;other than the fact it left me disappointed. Set on capturing the feel of 90&rsquo;s style space combat simulators you would hope for some amazing moments and solid systems. Sadly though the title fails in all those respects and ends up being a game full of frustration and issues.</p><p>The game has a number of different modes including a story mode, trial mode and an number of training missions . All of these control the same it&rsquo;s just that the objectives and pacing of each mode is different. You find yourself taking control of a number of different spacecraft and undertaking a range of missions. From escorting supply ships to having dogfights in asteroid belts.&nbsp;<em>Starfighter Origins</em>&nbsp;puts the player in a number of situations but sadly the enjoyment is short-lived.</p><p>The core gameplay controls within the game allow you to fly your ship with a number of movement options available. You can upgrade your ships throughout the campaign and have these carry over to the other game modes which is a nice addition. Keeping in the style of other space flight simulator titles you are always able to look around freely of the ship&#39;s heading helping for better situational awareness. The actual act of flying through space is fun but due to some of design choices it can be hard to master the ships and use them effectively. For example, engaging in combat was by far one of the most boring elements of&nbsp;<em>Starfighter Origins</em>.</p><p>What makes it feel so disappointing is the speed and control of the ships themselves. You see, when engaging in a dogfight in space you would hope for tight turning circles, effective locking onto enemy ships and the option to change your controls. Sadly, all of these are not as they should be. For one, the options available to change and adjust your controls are just awful with hardly any options present. As for the handling of the ships, they never feel as responsive as they should and most of the time you find yourself struggling to make even the most basic of movements.</p><p>I can&rsquo;t even think of anything positive to say about the menus and interfaces within&nbsp;<em>Starfighter Origins</em>. For a start, there are two different menu screens. One for the main menu and another for inflight use. Why these are different and poorly designed is beyond me. The main menu feels unfinished and some of the settings I&rsquo;m not even sure worked. It&rsquo;s a shame because the first interaction you have with the game is the menu and right off the bat you feel a sense of concern for the quality.</p><p>Touching on the presentation of the title it is clear that a fair amount of thought went into the design process. Using the Unreal Engine,<em>&nbsp;Starfighter Origins</em>&nbsp;does have some level of graphic fidelity and on the higher settings looks okay. Sadly, everything feels and looks unfinished along with being rusted and damaged. This matches the design but honestly is just boring and unpleasant to look at. Sound design is the next low mark for the game and it is filled with some poor voice acting and sounds that overlap each other. The result is annoyance for the player and a level of quality that feels poor and unfinished.</p><p><em>Starfighter Origins</em>&nbsp;could have been a solid title with a lot of replay value. It is easy to see that the ideas are there but sadly the final outcome is far from ideal. Being able to recommend the title is hard and honestly it is worth avoiding this one for now. Of course, should it get some updates to address a number of the issues and frustrations then&nbsp;<em>Starfighter Origins</em>&nbsp;could be a good, if not great, title. For now though I&rsquo;m sorry to say that its next flight is grounded.</p>'),

(148,	'<p>Sniper Elite III is a third-person tactical shooter stealth video game developed and published by Rebellion Developments. The game is a prequel to its 2012 predecessor Sniper Elite V2, and is the third installment in the Sniper Elite series.</p><p><strong>Sniper Elite III&nbsp;SEE DEAL</strong>&nbsp;is a celebration of extravagant carnage - and, less significantly, a big improvement over 2012&#39;s Sniper Elite V2. Its predecessor&#39;s stiff, linear gameplay has been swapped out for a more open-ended, creativity-enabling approach to stealth-shooting. But the big draw &ndash; the real draw &ndash; is the same pornographically violent X-ray-vision carnage that erupts whenever your bullets meet their targets.</p><p>These slow-motion, long-range kills are what keep Sniper Elite III from being just another generic-looking World War II shooter. Every effort was made to milk them for dramatic tension. When aiming, you can hold your breath, slowing time so you can watch that red dot shrink in on your target. Tight close-ups of the bullet in flight are accompanied by a steadily swelling roar, giving your shot a sense of impending destiny. Provided your reaction to the resulting gore is a sick thrill and not actual sickness, this is so immensely satisfying that it renders every other weapon at your disposal anticlimactic by comparison.<br /><br />The kill-cam moments never got old enough for me to opt to skip them, but they might have if the rest of Sniper Elite III weren&#39;t so competently designed. Centering on Karl, a gravel-voiced American sniper, who seems to almost singlehandedly dismantle the German Afrika Korps, you are taken to a lot of interesting settings in a theater of the war that&#39;s rarely explored in games, and given semi-free rein to explore and murder Nazi occupiers in whatever way you deem fit. That&rsquo;s what gives Sniper Elite III its edge - and not its story, which is awash in clich&eacute;s and occasionally laughable dialogue.<br /><br />The campaign consists of just eight stages, but they&rsquo;re a blast to creep through. Each one is enormous and has multiple objectives meant to give you a clear progression through the map, but how you reach and tackle those objectives is up to you. And when you factor in handfuls of enjoyable optional tasks, like blowing up a German motor pool or stealing top-secret plans, and the many deaths you&#39;re likely to die, finishing a single level can take as long as a couple of hours.With a guard AI that&rsquo;ll usually spot you if you run or even poke your head up above cover, Sniper Elite III encourages you to take it slow and stealthy, spotting and tagging guards with your binoculars. And should you decide to take a shot with anything but your silenced pistol &ndash; like, say, your sniper rifle &ndash; it&#39;s a good idea to either be near some noisy machinery that&#39;ll cover up the sound, or immediately move somewhere else after you take your shot.<br /><br />This push to relocate gives Sniper Elite III a fun, furtive cat-and-mouse feel, although like most stealth games, it doesn&#39;t always make sense; all you need to do is sneak or run a prescribed distance away from the guards until they forget you ever existed.<br /><br />But remember, there&#39;s no penalty for breaking stealth &ndash; and because you mainly earn experience through kills, there&#39;s no real reason not to clutter the horizon with bodies if you can get away with it. Dropping guards in quick succession always left me feeling like an efficient badass, even when it was due more to their uneven combat AI than my own skill.Sniper Elite III&#39;s multiplayer maps are huge and filled with hiding places, and they&#39;re built to emphasize distance and sneakiness. In fact, two of the standout modes are Distance King and No Cross, which respectively reward teams based on the range of their kills, and separate them with impassable barriers meant to force them to snipe. These modes are enjoyable, but they&#39;re not fundamentally different from what you&#39;d find in any other online shooter. Co-op, on the other hand, is much more rewarding. Not only can you tackle the entire campaign with a buddy, but you can also pair up in the waves-of-Nazis Survival mode and the engrossing Overwatch, which hands binoculars to one player and a rifle to the other, forcing you to work together as a sniper-spotter team.</p><p>Verdict</p><p>Sniper Elite III&#39;s open level designs and objectives pack in more than enough variety and stealthy tension to counterbalance its thin story and shaky enemy intelligence, and experimenting with its explosive traps is almost as fun as popping skulls with a sniper rifle. The skeleton-shattering, long-distance kills are still its riveting centerpiece, of course, but even without the element of dumb fun they offer, Sniper Elite III would still be a smart, unexpectedly memorable experience.</p>'),

(275,	'<p>Since the title does nothing to suggest what the game actually<em> is,</em> let&rsquo;s start by explaining that <em>The Slater</em> is a first person stealth/shooter with some similarities to the <em>Hitman</em> series. You play as grizzled former cop Mark Slater (hence the title), who is trying to avenge the death of his father and wipe out the production of &ldquo;D-Pain,&rdquo; a highly addictive designer drug that has become a scourge on the city. Over six or so missions, you gradually infiltrate deeper and deeper into the belly of the D-Pain beast as you investigate and mostly kill those responsible.</p><p>Despite the ambiguous title, the game description sounds pretty good, right? Unfortunately, while premise suggests a <em>Hitman</em>-like expedition into crime and punishment and stylish stealth, <em>The Slater</em> misses the mark by a disappointingly large margin. From its generally awful graphics, models and textures to its inconsistent gameplay, <em>The Slater </em>desperately needs a refresher course in what was fun about games in the genre.</p><p>Fundamentally, stealth/action games need to nail two things: stealth and action. Both need to feel fluid, logical and satisfying. In the case of <em>The Slater, </em>though,<em> </em>general movement is painfully slow (the only other option is running) and the &ldquo;stealth&rdquo; elements mostly consist of tailing a subject into a room, killing them and then hiding the body. Short of attacking a guard or main character in front of another guard, no one pays the slightest attention to Slater. He can be stopped by a guard, go knock out a waiter and change into waiter&rsquo;s clothes and then pass by the same guard a minute later without remark. Even weirder, Slater can kill a guard and steal his clothes and pass himself off as a guard, no questions asked. He can break into a house and steal a party invitation &mdash; again, in plain sight &mdash; and then waltz into the party with the invite. In other words, the enemy AI has two settings: off or kill. Since there are no mid-level saves, failure means replaying the entire level. <em>The Slater</em> would like us to believe that there are multiple solutions to every situation, but that is hardly the case. The biggest set of options comes in discovering some shortcut or access point.</p><p>I realize that games like <em>Hitman</em> &mdash; heck, <em>all </em>games&mdash;require a suspension of disbelief and an acceptance of some logic that contradicts the real world. In <em>The Slater,</em> though, we have to accept brain dead AI, terrible combat and distracting, ugly figure models that stare longingly into the uncanny valley. With the exception of Mark Slater, most of the characters look like they were crafted from soft wax, with lifeless eyes and barely functioning mouths. While the spare voice acting is on the acceptable side, the actual writing is mostly artless and heavily laden with tough guy cliche and <em>The Slater</em> contains not a shred of humor, ironic or otherwise.</p><p>Sound design is probably the least sophisticated I&rsquo;ve encountered lately, with pallid weapon and fighting effects, nonexistent area or musical transitions and little sense of a defined aural space. The disappointing presentation extends beyond the character models to the animation and textures, most of which are adequate at best, but it wouldn&rsquo;t matter if the core gameplay was good or the graphics didn&rsquo;t pull us out of the experience. There are three basic character types: cookie-cutter guards, mission targets and space-filler characters &mdash; easily identified by the repeated models that the game barely tries to conceal. Attending a party where all the female guests are wearing the same red evening gown suggests that either they belong to a neighborhood cult or the developer couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to re-skin or re-color the models.</p><p>Assuming one doesn&rsquo;t fail too many missions, <em>The Slater</em> is a relatively short game with virtually no replay value as trying to get a better overall score isn&rsquo;t much of an incentive to laboriously move through the same sequences again. Somewhere deep down I think that <em>The Slater</em> has a decent premise, but there is so much wrong with the execution I had a hard time finding it.</p>'),

(278,	'<p>With the gaming scene brimming with increasingly complex games, Brainy Studio&rsquo;s quirky little indie title, TurnOn, reminds us that sometimes less is more. And they seem to go above and beyond to try and prove this point, perhaps at times to a fault. Turning the platforming genre on its head, while capturing some of the essence of the genre&rsquo;s notoriety for simplicity, TurnOn manages to stand out with its distinct style, while offering an overall fun experience with a simple learning curve. At the same time, the game perhaps relies a little&nbsp;<em>too</em>&nbsp;much on its simplistic, albeit unique, gameplay mechanics, rather than building on its spark of innovation with real depth or variety of gameplay; almost to the point of making the novel concept begin to feel somewhat repetitive after prolonged playthroughs. The potential is there, and while there are definitely moments where the game shines bright, there seemed to be just as many instances where my experience fell a little flat.</p><p>Unlike most of its brethren, TurnOn holds the distinction of being a platformer&nbsp;<em>without</em>&nbsp;platforms, and provides an interesting overall premise to boot. You control an ambiguous alien-like being which takes the form of an electric spark named Turnon. With the help of a stereotypical geeky mad scientist, you set out with your cute little electric bundle of joy on a series of missions to help restore electricity to a darkened city brimming with inhabitants who are distraught and helpless from the loss of their precious electricity.</p><p>As you are essentially an orb of concentrated electricity, power lines are, quite naturally, your primary means of transportation, in addition to occasional electric currents; both of which act as the replacement for your typical platforms. This means that your movement is essentially limited to shifting one of four directions as you glide across jumbles of wiring which are spread liberally across the city. This concept provides the backbone of the gameplay, and instantly allows for a gaming experience that is simple to jump right into. The title as a whole proves to be quite straightforward, figuratively&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;literally speaking. The game was clearly meant to be welcoming to the more casual gamer, as there are few real dangers and little at stake. There are also plenty of checkpoints (which cleverly come in the form of fuseboxes which you activate upon touching) throughout each mission, ensuring you are never too inconvenienced.</p><p>Your main goals in most of the stages are to trigger various events by merely touching them with your electrically-juiced body. Brainy Studio cleverly and seamlessly fuses the gameplay with the narrative here, as you frequently follow minor character stories by aiding them with your electricity, prompting them to engage in amusing little actions as they achieve their goals. You will often be forced, or at least encouraged, to power various buildings, vehicles, and equipment to help people go about their day. Some of these more elaborate events include lighting pathways to help a little girl find her way home, clearing roads so that separated lovers can meet each other at a local cafe, and even rescue several frightened people stranded on a broken down Ferris wheel by restoring power. Some of these events are minor side-ventures, while others are integral to progressing and finishing the level itself. In this sense, TurnOn provides a feeling of being involved with a narrative and provides at least a subtle sense of interaction, which is difficult to achieve with such a simple game.</p><p>Despite the ability to play around with these minor objectives scattered about, complete with many diverging paths, many of the stages can still be completed relatively quickly. You can certainly drive up the amount of time it takes to burn through this otherwise brief experience if you happen to be a perfectionist, as the game also provides a hefty dose of collectables which can be found all over the city, coming in the form of blue lightning bolts. Additionally, you can gain quick points by turning on lights, and generate power to various items that require electricity such as fans. From a practical standpoint, these achieve nothing aside from building your rank which is presented to you following each completed mission, ranging from one to three &ldquo;lights.&rdquo; While essentially meaningless, they act as a sort of minor incentive for the player to return to previously visited stages and inject a bit of replay value to a game which doesn&rsquo;t exactly entice multiple playthroughs with its simplistic approach.</p><p>Though these various items and points of interest help add some meat to the gameplay, they can also present some frustration at times, as most of the stages consist of multiple layers of wires, each with their own set of goodies. This leads to inevitable backtracking if you prefer to leave no stone unturned, or even if you simply have trouble finding the next story event, which is not always particularly apparent. On top of this, the game also utilizes a sort of 2.5D system of placing paths in the foreground and background, which most stages take advantage of to one degree or another. While offering a neat new dimension (pun intended) to TurnOn&rsquo;s flat terrain, they can be a bit jarring at times. This disjointedness is further emphasized by the strange inconsistency of the character&rsquo;s perspective size not changing to coincide with his transporting onto the foreground or background. It is perhaps a minor nitpick, but it does really break some of the immersion the game provides. There is also the occasional issue of power lines being placed offscreen (either in the foreground or off to the side) which you are sometimes unable to even see unless you take a misguided leap of faith towards a potential early demise. For a game that utilizes these wires as the primary means of movement, making them a bit more visible could have proven to be a subtle yet meaningful improvement.</p><p>TurnOn also mixes things up a bit with some less frequent on-rails stages that feel a bit like those intense mine cart levels in the Donkey Kong Country series. Unlike the main missions which emphasize exploration and subtle puzzle elements, these stages crank up the pace and focus on action and fast reaction times. The game&rsquo;s music takes center stage here, as the rhythms more-or-less dictate the timing of when you should jump or drop to avoid obstacles. During these stages, you are forced to glide constantly onwards as you maneuver to avoid pitfalls and enemies which come in the form of red lightning bolts. Despite the further simplified controls in these segments, ironically I often found them more difficult than the main stages, as one wrong move can send you plummeting to a swift death. The controls can be somewhat unresponsive which become especially apparent during these instances. I&rsquo;ve run into more than a few instances of sliding off the edge of a power line despite seemingly hitting the jump key in time.</p><p>As a whole though, these action-based musical missions offered a welcome change of pace and were fun to play for the most part. After playing these unique stages though, I couldn&rsquo;t help but yearn to play a third or even fourth variant on the unique platforming style TurnOn establishes. There is a relative lack of variation and depth which becomes more apparent the more you press on, and feels like a bit of a missed opportunity for the otherwise interesting concept the game presents. And aside from a few levels that throw you some curve balls (like trying to take out a drone, or scramble up a skyscraper before a current of electricity wipes you out), the game more or less sticks to this rigid formula of puzzle-focused collectathons, with some action-oriented jumping stages thrown in. Boss stages could have been interesting, or at the very least, some more elaborate missions that included more enemies or obstacles to avoid while you zip your way to the goal.</p><p>This isn&rsquo;t to say that the game does much wrong with the content it does provide. It actually does a pretty good job of achieving what it sets out to accomplish - serving as a unique platformer with a mellow style that is sure to provide you some enjoyment in small doses. But by the same token, the game seems to play it safe whilst not fully utilizing its own strengths, and this flaw is further illuminated by some repetition and lack of content. I also didn&rsquo;t typically feel challenged throughout my electrically charged journey, and, with the frequency of checkpoints and lack of enemies, was able to breeze to the end with relative ease. I suppose it is meant to be an easygoing experience, which is exemplified in part by its cutesy, simplistic graphic style and its soothing piano melodies. Those looking for a more fleshed-out and challenging platforming experience will not find it here. At the end of the day, TurnOn feels like an interesting concept which, despite some shining moments of fun, left me wanting a bit more overall.</p>'),
