In fact, the most common enemy lies within: our ego. Early in our careers, it impedes learning and the cultivation of talent. With success, it can blind us to our faults and sow future problems.

Stoics focus on the things they&nbsp;<em>can</em>&nbsp;control, let go of everything else, and turn every new obstacle into an opportunity to get better, stronger, tougher. As Marcus Aurelius put it nearly 2000 years ago: &ldquo;The impediment to action advances action.&nbsp;What stands in the way becomes the way.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /><br />Ryan Holiday shows us how some of the most successful people in history&mdash;from John D.
